# Infinity Face Off
### an Infinity the Game N4 expected wounds calculator

[Infinity Face Off](https://khepri.netlify.app) is small web app that allows
players of Infinity the Game to quickly calculate the expected outcome
of a face to face roll. It is intended to be used to evaluate profiles
and for new players to get of feel of the often unintuitive face 2 face
roll probabilities. 

It's a static, single page application written in Javascript using react. 
The site does not require any backend other than a webserver to serve the files.
The actual die probability rolls are done using the incredible 
[icepool](https://github.com/HighDiceRoller/icepool) library. 
To run python on the client side web browser, we use WASM and the Pyodide
library.

# Installing

I use [volta](https://volta.sh/) to sync versions of node and yarn. Once
that is installed, a simple `yarn` command should get you running.

# Contributing

Pull requests and contributions are welcome, but I do have a vision for this
project and I suggest you write in first.
